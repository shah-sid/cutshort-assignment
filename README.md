To run the assignment , you just need to have node installed on the system.
There are 2 files to run : 
1. index.js
2. test.js

To run just enter node (filename).
index.js contains the code that takes every transaction seperately where as test.js has the code which clubs them.
Please let me know if you have any difficulty running it or if anything else that can be improved.
